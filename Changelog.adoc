== Current Version: 1.2.0

=== Ver 1.2.0
* It's been a while so I'll try my best here...
* New logo and site texture
* New "Search for a creature" feature
* Implemented a monster manual integration to help
* Stat blocks are visible on the right side of the page if the monster is from the MM
  * sometimes you can click on the weapons there to port them over to your mob
* Added Cows as an option
* added a clear mob area button
* increasing the mob number will add a little stack effect to the box


=== Ver 1.1.0
* We're just skipping over the deployment of 1.0.3 because this has gotten so much larger than I expected it to be.
* Added Extra Attack functionality to mobs
  - Updates to post attack details to support multiattackers
  - List of multiattack creature types: Velociraptor (the OG),
  - Added a button to clone a mob. Helpful! (and painful to code!)
* Added "Clone Mob" button to toolbar, was way harder to implement that it probably should have been

=== Ver 1.0.3
* Code improvements. No visible changes.
* Altered a few regex using 's' flag. Almost all browsers support it, but the tool does not work at all if a person is using an older version for whatever reason.

* Added creature variants:
  - Kobold/Winged Kobold
  - Wolf/Dire Wolf
  - Elk/Giant Elk
  - Boar/GiantBoar
  - Psn Snake/GP Snake/Flying Snake/Constrictor Snake
* Variants display/hide button
* Conditions outside of a DC block were not applying correctly. Now they are.
* Cleaned up how the notes look when inflicting multiple conditions at once (LOOKING AT YOU CONSTRICTOR SNAKE)

=== Ver 1.0.1
* Added Mobs:
  - Velociraptor
  - Giant Owl
  - Goblin
  - Orc
  - Bandit
