== Current Version: 1.0.2

=== Ver 1.1.0
* We're just skipping over the deployment of 1.0.3 because this has gotten so much larger than I expected it to be.
* Added Extra Attack functionality to mobs
  - Updates to post attack details to support multiattackers
  - List of multiattack creature types: Velociraptor (the OG),
  - Added a button to clone a mob. Helpful! (and painful to code!)
* Added "Clone Mob" button to toolbar, was way harder to implement that it probably should have been

=== Ver 1.0.3
* Code improvements. No visible changes.
* Altered a few regex using 's' flag. Almost all browsers support it, but the tool does not work at all if a person is using an older version for whatever reason.

=== Ver 1.0.2
* Added creature variants:
  - Kobold/Winged Kobold
  - Wolf/Dire Wolf
  - Elk/Giant Elk
  - Boar/GiantBoar
  - Psn Snake/GP Snake/Flying Snake/Constrictor Snake
* Variants display/hide button
* Conditions outside of a DC block were not applying correctly. Now they are.
* Cleaned up how the notes look when inflicting multiple conditions at once (LOOKING AT YOU CONSTRICTOR SNAKE)

=== Ver 1.0.1
* Added Mobs:
  - Velociraptor
  - Giant Owl
  - Goblin
  - Orc
  - Bandit
  - Hobgoblin
