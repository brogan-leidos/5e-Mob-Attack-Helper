</div>
<div class="category">
	Hello, and thank you for checking out my site! <br>
	I started development on Mobby5e after realizing that my necromancer PC was about to break into a new realm of action economy that would likely make me very happy, and other plays at the table very unhappy. <br>
	What started as a simple script for a necromancer, rapidly evolved into a general tool that could be used by any class, and even DMs! <br>
	Fast forward a few months of work, and here we are at the official release of Mobby5e. I couldn't be more excited to share it with you all.
	
	Mobby5e is protected unter the MIT liscense, please feel free to find more information on that, and to see the source code at it's <a href="https://github.com/brogan-leidos/5e-Mob-Attack-Helper">Github</a> page.

  Mobby 5e is a passion project of mine, and I've always intended to release it as a complete and comprehensive tool that will always be free for anyone to use.<br>
  If you'd like to support the site, please be the cool guy/girl at the table who can efficiently manage your minions in combat, and let your questioning friends in on the secret as to how you do it.<br>
  All of that being said, if you'd like to do something greater than spread the word, and help with the sites upkeep, or give me a tip for the effort, then thank you. Truely.
