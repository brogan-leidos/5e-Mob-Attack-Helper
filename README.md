# 5e Mob Attack Helper
If you're like me and find the DMG rules for mob combat underwhelming - this is the tool for you!
This tools intention is to allow all aspiring druids, necromancers, and warlords to fulfill their wildest mass combat dreams; without the hassle of hearing your friends groan as you request to shoot a goblin with 40 skeletons at once.

ToDo:
  - Save a JSON of current configuration
  - Error checking when things dont go correctly in one of the fields
  - A more versatile weapon input system

Known issues:
  - It's a bit ugly, and I'm a bit terrible at CSS
  - (+/-) split problem in weapon parse. Low priority
