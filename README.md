# Site Test
Front facing site test. Hopeful to deploy a simple app for coding practice and practicality

ToDo:
  - Make the info box a bit easier to comprehend: showing an expandable version of each mob's damage might work
  - Delete mobs
  - Enable/disable mobs
  - Weapon menu for present mobs
  - Save a JSON of current configuration


Known issues:
 - Damage calculation cant work unless damage type is specified
     Format: [X]d[X] +/- [X] <damage type>
 - Adv/Dis is a bit messed up when creating new mobs
 - I think the number resets as well when creating new mobs
