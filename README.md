# Mobby - A DnD 5e Mob Attack Helper Tool
If you're like me and find the DMG rules for mob combat underwhelming - this is the tool for you!
This tools intention is to allow all aspiring druids, necromancers, and warlords to fulfill their wildest mass combat dreams; without the hassle of hearing your friends groan as you request to shoot a goblin with 40 skeletons at once.

== ToDo:  
  1. A "Copy Mob button" - to quickly an easily create a variant on something you already made
  2. Conditions outside of the mechanical ones (Other selection)
  Far Future: Save a JSON of current configuration

== Known issues:
  - Damage tooltips are a little wonkey when the number is large. Look into CSS positioning fixes!
  - ~It's a bit ugly, and I'm a bit terrible at CSS~ It's looking a bit better and I'm a little better at CSS!
  - This implementation of the weapon parser uses eval(). It works for most everything, but maybe theres a problem here I'm missing?

Note: If you're brave enough to venture into the source code, you have my condolences. This was my first ever shot at a JS project, and I can now say with certainty that it is a bit of a MESS. You have been warned - god speed brave adventurer (-_-)7
