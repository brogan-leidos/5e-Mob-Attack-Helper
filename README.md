# 5e Mob Attack Helper
If you're like me and find the DMG rules for mob combat underwhelming - this is the tool for you!
This tools intention is to allow all aspiring druids, necromancers, and warlords to fulfill their wildest mass combat dreams; without the hassle of hearing your friends groan as you request to shoot a goblin with 40 skeletons at once.

ToDo:
  1. Allow options to Disallow/Always crit target
  2. Hoverable damage information under the attack details
  3. Revise weapon parsing to allow multiple kinds of dice and modifiers in a single input box
  Far Future: Save a JSON of current configuration

Known issues:
  - It's a bit ugly, and I'm a bit terrible at CSS
  - (+/-) split problem in weapon parse. Low priority

Note: If you're brave enough to venture into the source code, you have my condolences. This was my first ever shot at a JS project, and I can now say with certainty that it is a bit of a MESS. You have been warned - god speed brave adventurer (-_-)7
